## About this song
"The Game of Love" is a song written and recorded by French electronic music duo Daft Punk for their fourth studio album, Random Access Memories.
It is the second track on the album.
The song features lyrics performed by Daft Punk using vocoders.

This song features vocoder singing by the duo.
Thomas Bangalter expressed that "Thereâ€™s this thing today where the recorded human voice is processed to try to feel robotic."
He explained that their intention was to produce robotic vocals with expressiveness and emotion.
Nick Stevenson of Mixmag described "The Game of Love" as "a song about lost love that tugs at the heart strings, even if it is being sung by an android."

For the robotic vocals heard throughout Random Access Memories, Daft Punk restricted themselves to using vintage vocoders and avoided software plugins.
When asked which of the two Daft Punk members performed the vocoder lyrics, Bangalter expressed that it did not matter.
The duo produced most of the vocoder tracks in their own private studio in Paris, with later processing done by Mick Guzauski at Capitol Records.
Giorgio Moroder elaborated that Daft Punk would take "a week or so" to find an adequate vocoder sound, and an additional few days to record the lyrics

Written and produced by: Thomas Bangalter Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo

## Lyrics
<pre>
There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you the one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away

There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you the one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When I wanted you to stay

And it was you
I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
</pre>
